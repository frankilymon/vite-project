Using code snapshots
Code snapshots (which you find in /code) are there for you to compare your code to mine and find + fix errors you might have in your code.

You can either view my code directly here on Github (you can open + view code files without issues here) or you download the snapshots.

The subfolders in the /code folder are named such that mapping them to the course lectures is straightforward.

Downloading code snapshots
You can download all the content of a branch via the "Code" button here on Github. You can then either clone the repository or simply download the selected branch content as a ZIP file.

Important: You always download the entire branch content!

You can then dive into the interesting folders (e.g. the individual code snapshots) locally on your hard drive.

Running the attached code
You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it.

To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first.

Then run npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder).
